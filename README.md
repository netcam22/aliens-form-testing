# Testing React Components

Terrible news! Aliens have invaded Earth. 👽 👾 👽 👾 👽 👾

Luckily, their species is _incredibly_ bureaucratic 📝

The aliens have promised to spare the Earth if we can submit form W-12-M without making a single mistake. You've been chosen for your skills at testing React components to ensure we cannot get it wrong.

## This Exercise

This is a challenging exercise. You'll build a simple version of the above form, write tests to make sure it works, then add validation to the fields, and then write more tests to ensure the validation works. Finally there are some extensions to push you even further!

But don't be afraid - not even of the aliens. There are some extra hints available if you get stuck, and if you get super stuck you can always reach out to us on Slack and we'll help you get going again.
