# Activity 3 - Build Your Form Simply

The simplest version of this form does NO validation. So let's build that first.

## Step 1 - Add input fields and their labels

According to the aliens, each field should have a `<label>` and a corresponding tag for the input:

| Label              | Input Type     | Values                        |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Species Name       | text input tag |                               |
| Planet Name        | text input tag |                               |
| Number of beings   | text input tag |                               |
| What is 2 + 2      | select tag     | two option tags: "4", "Not 4" |
| Reason for sparing | textarea tag   |                               |

ðŸ’¡ Don't forget we're in the world of React, so each input field needs to store its value somewhere in `state` - the `useState` hook will be required here.

As a refresher for inputs-with-state, for each input you'll need something like:

```TSX
<input type='text' value={myStateVariable} onChange={doSomethingHereToUpdateState} />
```

(Of course, not all of the required fields are `<input>` tags so you may need to remind yourself of how `<select>` and `<textarea>` work - luckily, they're very similar to `<input>`)

ðŸ¤” QUESTION - where is the best place in our app to _store_ this state?

Hint: It may seem at first as if each `<input>` field should store its own state... but think about the moment of submitting the form. At that point the whole form needs to know the state of each component so it can send the data to the server. It often ends up being cleaner for the form component to be the place where 'form state' is stored.

The general principle here is that all state should be stored at the "highest" place in the tree that needs to know about that state... but no higher. This is to prevent us from storing ALL our state in the `App` component - imagine how massive that component would get for a large project! But if we go too far the other way, with each tiny component managing its own state, it becomes very difficult to _combine_ that data together when we need to. The more experienced you get with React, the more it will become obvious where a given piece of state should be stored.

## Step 2 - Add a submit button

Lastly your form will need to submit. In the final product we'd probably want to send the data to a server, but we can just use our submit button to check that all of our components are working correctly.

ðŸ‘‰ For now, hook the button up with a click handler which logs to the console all the data entered to the form when you press submit.

ðŸ‘‰ (Optional) Rather than logging to the console, can you add a new component beneath the form which displays the entered form data on the page when you press submit? You'd have to pass to this new component both the current state of all the components, and some kind of flag that tells it that submit has been pressed...

Once you're happy you've built a basic form and hooked up some kind of submit function, let's move onto [Activity 4](./activity_4.md).
